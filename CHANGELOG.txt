LogWatcher 1.1 changes since 1.0:
----------------------------------

- Filters: Highlight a line or skip a line when a pattern is matched.
- New action: Erase display (like the regular console viewer, RFE #667659)
- New icons (stolen from elsewhere in Eclipse)
- Bugfix: Notice truncated and delete files (also part of RFE #667659)
