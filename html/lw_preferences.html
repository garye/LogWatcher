<h1>LogWatcher Preferences</h1>

<p>To configure the preferences for the LogWatcher plug-in, go to Window &gt; Preferences &gt; LogWatcher. 

<p>From there, you may choose the font, style, text size and default color used to display 
the file contents in the LogWatcher view. This affects all the watchers in the view but 
it will not override any font color highlighting done by filters.

<p>Also, LogWatcher can be configured to automatically reopen the files it was watching when
Eclipse was shut down. This can save time by not requiring the watchers to be recreated each time
Eclipse starts. To set this option, check the box next to "Restart previously open watchers on restart".
