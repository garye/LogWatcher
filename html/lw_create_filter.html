<h1>Defining a Filter</h1>

<p>To create a filter for a watcher, press <b>"New Filter"</b> on the "Create New Watcher" window.
Multiple filters can be created for the same watcher, and can be configured to perform different
actions.

<h2>Matching Options</h2>

<p>For all types of filters, you may choose whether the filter action should be 
performed when the text <em>does</em> match the line or when it <em>does not</em>. This can
be configured through the drop down box next to the search field.

<p>Each filter can be created to be case sensitive or case insensitive. The default is
case insensitive, which means that differences in capitalization are ignored.

<h2>Simple Text Matching</h2>

<p>The simplest way to construct a filter is to type in the text that you want to match. The filter
will then search for that text in any part of the line.

<h2>Regular Expressions</h2>

<p>Filters support regular expressions that follow the Perl5 syntax.
If you wish to make more complicated expression matching, you
may want to look at the online
<a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.6/pod/perlre.html">Perl 5 Regular Expression documentation</a>.


<h2>Examples of Regular Expressions</h2>

<p>To match a simple string, just type it in the search field:
<br><b><code>Error</code></b>

<br>would match all lines that contains that text at any point within it.

<p>To match a simple string that appears at the beginning of a line:
<br><b><code>^Error</code></b>

<p>To match a simple string that appears at the end of a line:
<br><b><code>Error$</code></b>

<p>To match a repeatition of digits that appears at exactly 4 in a row, such as a year:
<br><b><code>(\d){4}</code></b>


<h2>Filter Actions</h2>

<p>Each filter has an associated action with it. This action is performed
for every line in the file that satisfies the matching options.


<h3>Highlight Line</h3>

<p>When the filter is matched, the line will be highlighted in the color
chosen through the wizard. This can be helpful to flag unusual log messages
such as warnings or error messages.

<h3>Skip Line</h3>

<p>When the filter is matched, the line will not be displayed in the LogWatcher 
window. This can be helpful for ignoring unimportant text.

<h3>Add Todo Task</h3>

<p>When the filter is matched, a <b>Todo item</b> is added to the Tasks list. The name
and priority are configured through the new filter wizard.
